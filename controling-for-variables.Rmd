- Causal or Predictive?
  - If predictive, judge by out of sample fit and move on.
  - If causal, read on.

- why control?
  - bias (confounders that are associated with treatment and outcomes)

    - regression allows us to see associations holding other things constant
    - how to see if a confounder
  
  - precision
    show the formula for variance of a coefficient and explain how controling for things could reduce the variance (though it could also increase the variance).

- why not control?
  - different interpretation 
  - lose all your precision
  - if downstream effect, losing the effect
  - collider bias https://catalogofbias.org/biases/collider-bias/
  
  
  Regression models make it easy to measure the effect of a treatment holding other variables fixed.
